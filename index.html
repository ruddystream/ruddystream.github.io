<a id="ruddystreamgithubio" class="anchor" href="#ruddystreamgithubio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This is A Ruddy Stream</h1>

<p>A silly webpage for my dumb projects.</p>

<h2>
<a id="who" class="anchor" href="#who" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who?</h2>

<p>I'm just a 42 year old average computer liking dude.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h2>

<p>This is my pseudo-anonymous place to publicly brush up my coding skills.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>I've been in system administration now for almost 20 years, and while I enjoy it, I really miss building things. I used to make cool stuff way back when on my Commodore 64, and at one point had aspirations of getting into game development and programming.</p>

<h2>
<a id="where" class="anchor" href="#where" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where?</h2>

<p>Ummm... here?</p>

<h2>
<a id="when" class="anchor" href="#when" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When?</h2>

<p>Okay, I guess I didn't think this out fully when I did the 5Ws. When is now and whenever I find time? </p>

<h2>
<a id="how" class="anchor" href="#how" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How?</h2>

<p>By starting to code stupid exercises more. </p>

<h2>
<a id="the-plan" class="anchor" href="#the-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The plan</h2>

<p>I'm most familiar with Perl, having used it for the majority of my sysadmin life, so I'm starting there, brushing up on it. I have a couple of projects to try with it, so that's a good start.</p>

<p>From there, I'd like to learn Go, and Swift. I was introduced to Go by a co-worker, and it really looks great, and I think that it's got a good chance of gaining traction as a server-side language. With any luck, it'll supplant javascript and node in the near future. As for Swift, we use it at my place of work, and I've got ideas for my own apps that I want to pursue.</p>

<p>Once I've got my Perl skills back to something resembling expertise, I'll start building actual projects. I'll mix in Swift next, probably, and start in on my iPad app ideas. Finally I'll add Go to the mix, so that I can build the back ends that I need.</p>
