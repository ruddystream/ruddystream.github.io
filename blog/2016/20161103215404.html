<h2>7, 8, 9</h2>
<p>I've just finished chapters 7, 8, and 9 of Learning Perl (not including the workbook for chapter 9... that'll take me another week to get into, I'm sure.)  It's taken me a month to work through them. That's a little more than a week per chapter. I suppose that's not too bad, considering that I don't do this nightly. But it still feels like I'm not moving too fast.</p>

<p>And then there's the fact that every time I come up to the exercises, I feel as if I've forgotten everything that I refreshed from the previous chapters. The last two exercises of chapter 9 weren't HARD, really... I just couldn't think of what to do to make them work, without reviewing the book, and peeking at the answer key.</p>

<p>I guess I've just got to put more time into it, and try hard to get better rest and exercise, and probably eat better too. It's days like this that I feel like I'm a living example of a macro from Da Share Z0ne. Tired but strong!</p>
