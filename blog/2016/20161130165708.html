<h2>Familiarity Breeds HAPPINESS!</h2>
<p>Today, I used perl in my job to write a test script. It's been a while since I even considered using perl. Usually I'd just fart around in bash or whatever npm crap I could scrape off of one of the developer's projects and fuck up until it did something that resembled what I wanted... but today, I actually felt confident enough in my abilities to write a new perl script.</p>

<p>Sure, it was half code I pulled from perldoc. Sure, I messed up half of the semi-colons. Sure, it took more googling than it should have. But DAMMIT I WROTE IT!</p>

<p>And that's why I am doing this. So that I feel comfortable again. This proves, at least to me, that I'm not just doing this as a masturbatory exercise.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm Level: Rising!</p>
