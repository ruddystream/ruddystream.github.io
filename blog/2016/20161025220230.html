<h2>Two Years</h2>
<p>I've been poking at this little exercise for just over two years now. It's not been terribly fast, and I hope it doesn't take a another two years to finish the book! </p>
<p>When I started on October 20th, 2014, I don't know if I thought it would take this long to go through Learning Perl. I assumed it would take me a couple of weeks, maybe a month, doing a chapter every couple of nights. I guess I assumed that a) I'd be able to keep the motivation up, and b) I'd have time, probably (a) more than (b), really. It didn't really help that I took a year off between chapters 3 and 4, and then the summer off between 4 and 5!<p>
<p>I have been doing better though. I've been working through it faster, partially because I'm getting more comfortable coding again, and partially because I've been pushing myself to dedicate more time to it. It helps that the children are in their teenage years, and want to spend less time with pops! ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>So my current goal is to get this book done by the end of December, in another two months. I don't think that's unreasonable. I'm halfway done, and I'm going about one chapter every week and a half, and picking up speed. If I can get it down to a week or less per chapter, I'll be good.</p>
<p>Then, there's Intermediate Perl, and Mastering Perl. All in all, I've got a lot of pages to read. Then, it's on to Swift, and Go. So I've pretty much got my goals for 2017 planned out!</p>
