<h2>Just a crappy blog</h2>
<p>I figured since I'm actually doing something that resembles work on here, I might as well spew some mud on the web, too.</p>
<p>Spent about two hours farting around with static site generators, before I remembered that the whole purpose of reviewing perl was to build my OWN static site generator, so why the eff would I install one? Better to just write the occasional crappy blog post in straight HTML for now.  It's not like I'm posting this snot anywhere.</p>
<p>Trying to force myself to make time to practice coding is hard, especially when it's so easy just to lay on the couch and zone out while poking at Clicker Heroes, and just let my brain disengage. Dangerous. So, I'm trying hard to stop that stupidness.</p>
<p>Anyhow, until later. Let's see if this crap actually worked, and it doesn't look like snot when I push it.</p>
