        <h2>What the hell is going on in the world?</h2>
        <p><small>Monday, December 9th, 2024 - 20:16</small></p>

        <p>So... what a weird world we live in these days, eh? I did <em>not</em> anticipate any of what's happening when I started this almost a decade ago.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, I am still here, and I am picking up where I left off. I have new idears for things I want to make, but I forgot everything I tried to learn, so I feel like I'm back at square one. I know I'm not, but frick it sure feels like it. So what I'm going to do is spend some time reading <em>Intermediate Perl</em> in conjunction with my current exercises to get myself up to speed. I anticipate being able to spend three hours a week on it in the evenings, and at approx 45 minutes per chapter, I figure 11-12 hours, give or take. If I call it middle of January to take the Christmastime into account (because I want to spend as much time with my adult children while they're home as I can, of course!), I think I can make it.</p>

        <p>But you know what? I'm not putting a timeline on this, and I'm not forcing myself. I'm doing this because I want to enjoy myself, dangit, not because I have a deadline.</p>

        <p>Anyhoo, catch ya soon.</p>
