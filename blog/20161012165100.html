<h2>FreeBSD first impressions as a Linux dude.</h2>
<p>While waiting for some computers to re-image at work, I decided to mess around a little with FreeBSD. I saw that there had been a new release (FreeBSD 11), and I've been meaning to fart around with it over the years. I've used NetBSD in a past life, and liked it, but that was even longer ago than the death of my game developer dreams. So I figured that now was as good a time to try something newish as any. On to a VirtualBox VM we go.</p>
<p>First thing I noticed was a quick and easy to use installer. This used to be a hallmark of the Linux distributions that I'd used over the years, but they've gotten graphical and more complex. Once I got used to the interface's expectations (after having trained myself on GUI rather than TUI interfaces for the past dcade), I waltzed through it pretty quick. Basic install, ZFS filesystem, pretty simple.</p>
<p><em>Note to self: have a look at this new-fangled ZFS.</em></p>
<p>Once everything was installed, I rebooted and logged in. I found I was using Csh, which was just not acceptable. What better way to learn the FreeBSD package manager than to install a more usable shell.</p>
<p><em>tikka-takka, web searching noises</em>. Oh, it looks like all I need to do is type</p>
<p><code>pkg add bash</code></p>
<p>Oh, it looks like it puts everything I install in /usr/local. Actually, I kinda like that idea.</p>

<p>Anyhow, a few minutes later, I'm bashing away in bash. I've gotta say, this is a good first impression. So I throw vim on there, because somehow, I've got muscle memory to type <em>vim</em> instead of <em>vi</em>. Whatever.</p>
<p><code>pkg add vim</code></p>

<p>Over 100 packages dependencies later (but still WAY fewer than messing around with node), I have the latest vim. Squee.</p>

<p>I'm going to have to experiment with this further. So far, package maintenance is easy, similar enough to yum that I've got a decent idea of what I'm doing. And between the googles and the FreeBSD handbook, I should have a decent handle on things.</p>
