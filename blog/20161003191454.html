<h2>Workin' my way through</h2>
    <p>Actually made it through Chapter 6 of Learning Perl and the Learning Perl Workbook. It's not that it's difficult, it's just that I find it difficult to actually make time for it.</p>
	<p>That's code for I find it difficult to do anything after work other than stare at useless video games, if we're being honest here. And I do mean useless. If I was playing something with a plot, or action, or interaction, I wouldn't feel bad. But Clicker Heroes has none of these.</p>
	<p>The next chapter is Regular Expressions. I freakin' LOVE regular expressions. I cut my teeth on regexes when I first learned perl... almost 20 years ago now.</p>
	<p>That touches a little on why I'm doing this anonymously. I'm embarrassed that I've let my skills lapse so badly.</p>
	<p>Sounds like my lovely child is out of band practice. I'll upload this, and call it a night for now. Wish me luck, people.</p>
