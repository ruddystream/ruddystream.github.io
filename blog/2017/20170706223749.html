<h2>Two Month Break</h2>
<p>Taking a two month break isn't the greatest thing to do. I can't say that it's helped anything here. But when you don't have the mental bandwidth, you don't have the mental bandwidth.</p>
<p>But, being on vacation and getting extra sleep and exercise makes things easier. A 4km walk in the mornings is a good thing. Spending time with my teenaged children (and them wanting to spend time with me!) is a good thing. It's given me some energy. Just a little bit, but enough that I am willing to spend it on This Silly Project. So back to it, then.</p>
<p>(Yes, I realize it's been more than two months since I've written here. This blog isn't my focus, though maybe it wouldn't hurt to put a little more into it.)</p>
