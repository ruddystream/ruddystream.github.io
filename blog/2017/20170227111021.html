<h2>A Bit On Seasonal Affective Disorder</h2>
<p>I suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, and I'd like to take a moment to talk about it.</p>

<p>Seasonal Affective Disorder, for those that don't know, is depression brought on by the winter months. It can happen to people in the summer months as well. In my case, though, I get the SAD, usually starting in late October / early November, and it generally receeds in the summer months. My dad recognized the tendencies in my when I was young, but we just called it my desire to hibernate in the winter, and didn't connect it to the depression at all. Over the years it's gotten bad enough that it stuck around through the summer, and hung on tight as full blown depression.</p>

<p>Generally to combat this, I'll pull out my super-bright light, and sit in front of it in the mornings for 20 minutes. Often just doing that a few times a month will really make a big difference. This year, though, I didn't sit in front of it enough, and I didn't realize until February was almost gone that it was affecting me this badly.</p>

<p>So, for the last two weeks, I've been trying to motivate myself to get out of the funk. It helps that the sun is up earlier (thank you to the inexorable march of the seasons), but it's still tough. I'll need to exercise outside a lot this summer to help innoculate myself, and get a good sunrise alarm to supplement my blue light.</p>

<p>Hopefully, with the impending spring, that means I'll be able to get myself going again. We'll see as the daylight improves!</p>
