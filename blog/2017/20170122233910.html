<h2>Learning Perl is Complete.</h2>
<p>After a little more than 820 days, or 2Â¼ years, I have completed <em>Learning Perl</em>.</p>

<p>How about a little fanfare?</p>

<p>That feels good. Of course, I've got the end-of-project blues now, but that'll pass as soon as I get to work on the next thing.</p>

<p>So, what's next?</p>

<p>I've got a copy of <em>Intermediate Perl, 2nd Edition</em>. That's going right into the mix. I've also got a copy of <em>Beginning iPhone Development with Swift 3</em>. I'd used the Apress books for learning Obj-C and iOS dev previously (like, 8 years ago!), so I'm familiar with their teaching style, and I liked the books. I feel like I'm coming back to it completely fresh, though, since the last time I tried to build anything for an iOS device was literally 6 years ago. I also have some ideas for projects that I am going to start poking at. Simple applications that'll work well with perl, that I can keep the skills I've been brushing up on from just falling off again. You won't see those here, but I might pretend to stumble across them someday in the future and star them and watch them. So, on the off chance that anybody's watching, they might show up in my list of stars somewhere soon. :)</p>

<p>I also want to read some non-technical books, too. I've got Robert Ludlum's <em>The Bourne Identity</em> sitting on my bedside table waiting for me to start it, and I'm part way through a political analysis book that I've been meaning to read for a few years. I've also got G.R.R. Martin's <em>A Dance With Dragons</em> that I've been slogging through, too. (Boy, that's a meaty read. Pun intended.). So hopefully my GoodReads list will increase in the next couple of months! I'm sort of shooting for one non-technical book a month.</p>

<p>I'd like to be working through these at about the same rate I've been going in the past little bit here with Learning Perl. It only took me four or five days to finish the last chapter... if I keep that pace up, with the non-technical reading, I'll be doing a chapter in each book roughly every two weeks. I'll try and mix them together, so that I keep the perl skills up, and improve the Swift skills at the same time.</p>

<p>There you have it. At that rate, both <em>Intermediate Perl</em> and <em>Beginning iPhone Development with Swift 3</em> should be done by November, and I'll have 12 non-technical books read. Maybe more, if I don't take two week long breaks in there! :)</p>
