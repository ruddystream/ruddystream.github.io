<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
<p>I'm getting close to finishing Learning Perl... FINALLY. I'm not going to hit the end of the year like I had hoped I would, but with only two chapters left, I feel like I'm close enough that it's acceptable.</p>

<p>Let's do a little Year In Review then, shall we?</p>

<p>In 2016, my desire to do something code-related kicked up its head again, leading me to pick this project back up near the start of the year. It took me a bit to get back into it, starting up again in August, and it took me a bit to get going seriously on it, really making regular attempts at reading and coding in October, but once I actually got my butt in gear, I made decent progress.</p>

<p>So next year, I'd like to do a few things. First, I want to finish Learning Perl. Considering I seem to be working at the pace of a chapter per week, that puts me in about the middle of January, 2017. That's acceptable.</p>

<p>Next, I want to tackle Intermediate Perl. It's actually a little shorter. Assuming I can keep up the pace of a chapter a week, it'll be about mid-May by the time I'm finished it.</p>

<p>At this point, I want to turn my attention to Swift. I have no idea how long it'll take to actually figure that out. The language is more complex, but hopefully I'll be able to move into it without hurting my brain too much. I'd hope that I would be at an intermediate level with it by the end of next year.</p>

<p>I also want to start on the two actual projects I want to use these languages for. One is an iPad app for managing role playing games, and the other is a static website generator. I should be able to start on the latter while I'm working on Intermediate Perl, and hopefully, I'll be able to start poking at the iPad app as I'm learning Swift. (What better way to really figure out a language than picking up a project, right?)</p>

<p>After those, there's also Go I want to start playing with. I think that's a little further in the future, though.</p>

<p>I think that these are reasonable goals for 2016 - Finish Intermediate Perl, make the static site generator software, start learning Swift, start the iPad app. After the last three months, it doesn't actually feel like that big of a stretch.</p>

<p>/rs.</p>
