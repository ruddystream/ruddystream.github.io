<h2>Too Long a Break</h2>
<h4>Posted on: Monday, January 16, 2017 CST</h4>
<p>Okay, that was too long of a break, really. I was slowly reading chapter 16, but I didn't motivate myself to get the exercises done until tonight. That said, I whipped through the exercises quite quickly, even number four, which I did WAY more than what I needed to. I kinda like the way it turned out, too. Fancy data table and everything, tracking signals. Workbook exercises are tomorrow, I suppose.</p>

<p>Then I have just one chapter left. FINALLY. What should have completed literally two years ago, I am finally on the cusp of completion how. It feels good, but I can't help but wonder how much further ahead in my desired projects I'd be if I'd buckled down better in October 2014, when I started.</p>

<p>Regardless, I didn't, it doesn't matter now if I had. What's important is that I'm working NOW, right?</p>

<p>One more chapter, then on to Intermediate Perl, and some Swift book. Probably the Apple one. Work's got a Linda account, too, so maybe I'll pick up the videos from there.</p>

<p>I'll check back in once I'm done the last chapter. Until then... "rock, rock on!"</p>

<p>(I'll come up with a better catchphrase, too, and not just steal The Cheat Commandos' tagline.)</p>
